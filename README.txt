Short-term forecasting is an important issue in the power management system and the main key measure sustainable and efficient operation of energy systems.

various models of machine learning and deep learning are used for predicting the requirement ofelectrical energy at the stations by applying different methods to forecast demand of energy at a particular station.

These models are impemented in python.

Libraries used : Keras based on tensorflow, sci-kit, numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
